│ BRANDING & NAMING (apply globally)                                           │
│   • Project / repo / product name: **TheCollective**                         │
│   • Attribution string: **Created By T.Rex-Baby**                            │
│   • Contact e-mail: **Info@The-Collective-I.co.uk**                          │
│   Every README, bundle ID, build artefact, diagram, and citation must use    │
│   these exact identifiers.                                                   │

│ CODING RULES (Sam’s Swift Philosophy — MUST-FOLLOW)                          │
│   1. No blind copying — relocating existing code is fine; all *new* Swift    │
│      must be fresh, declarative, documented.                                 │
│   2. File order & MARK zones exactly as specified (see separator style).     │
│   3. README hierarchy                                                        │
│        – One global **ReadMeSam.md** at repo root.                           │
│        – Optional per-package ReadMeSam.md if size warrants.                 │
│        – All `import …` lines (except in ContentView.swift) mirrored there.  │
│   4. Section separators use:                                                 │
│      `// ───────────────────────── Models ─────────────────────────`         │
│   5. Violations must be flagged in the risk register.                        │
│                                                                              │

│   • Analyse the default branch of every connected repo (public + private).   │
│   • Goal: unify them into a Bazel-based mono-repo **TheCollective** that     │
│     builds on Apple-silicon Mac, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, plus CI for Linux.    │

# **TheCollective Monorepo Integration Plan**

In this plan, we consolidate all listed repositories into a single Bazel-based mono-repo named **TheCollective**. This unification follows the prescribed branding and structuring rules, ensuring consistent naming, attributions, and build processes across the board. All modules, apps, and libraries are reorganized under a common structure, with legacy or redundant code moved to an archive (with appropriate README pointers to new locations). We maintain commit history where feasible during migration, and incorporate Bazel from scratch (using Apple and Swift Package Manager rules) to build the multi-platform components. All Swift code will be rewritten in a fresh, declarative style with proper documentation and using Sam’s code style conventions (consistent separators, import ordering, and detailed READMEs). Additionally, continuous integration is set up via GitHub Actions to build and test on macOS and Linux (with an eye toward scaling to other platforms). The identifier and branding standards are applied throughout (project name **TheCollective**, with file headers and docs attributing **Created by T.Rex-Baby** and contact **[Info@The-Collective-I.co.uk](mailto:Info@The-Collective-I.co.uk)**).

## **Proposed Repository Structure**

Below is the expanded **TheCollective** repository tree, showing top-level directories and how each migrated component fits into the new mono-repo. The structure groups code by domain and function (applications vs libraries vs tools), following the provided seed layout. Legacy or unused components are placed under `archive/` (excluded from Bazel builds) with README files referencing their new equivalents or external sources.

*(The above tree omits some files for brevity, focusing on overall structure. All names and paths use **TheCollective** branding. Each code file will include headers like “Created by T.Rex-Baby” and appropriate contact info.)*

## **Migration Plan by Domain**

The following tables detail the migration of each repository (source) into the **TheCollective** monorepo, organized by domain. For each domain grouping, we indicate the new location in the unified repo and any notes on conflict resolution, refactoring, or archiving.

### Poseidon Suite (Core Application & AI Modules)

This domain includes the main Poseidon application and its related modules: the PoseidonDashboard (Android UI), memory layer, scientist (automated researcher), and any Swift client code.

| **Source Repository (Path)**                | **Destination in TheCollective**     | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Poseidon* (main app codebase)              | `apps/poseidon/`                     | Main Poseidon app. If it contains backend logic, it resides in `apps/poseidon/server/`. All package identifiers renamed to `...thecollective.poseidon...` (branding update). Integrated with PoseidonDashboard UI as one app. Commit history preserved via subtree merge.                                                                                          |
| *PoseidonDashboard* (Android app)           | `apps/poseidon/android/`             | **Merged** into Poseidon app as Android client package. The separate Gradle project is converted to Bazel `android_binary`. Android package name changed from `hu.bme.aut.poseidondashboard` to `uk.co.thecollective.poseidon` (branding). Removed redundant build files; integrated Firebase config into Poseidon if needed.                                      |
| *PoseidonSwift* (iOS app, legacy)           | `apps/poseidon/ios/`                 | Reimplemented in SwiftUI from scratch following modern conventions. Old Swift code moved to `archive/PoseidonSwift_legacy/` with README pointing to new `apps/poseidon/ios/`. The new iOS app uses Swift Package Manager for any dependencies and Bazel `ios_application` for builds. All Swift files include the standard header banner (T.Rex-Baby attribution). |
| *PoseidonMemory* (“Mem0” memory layer)      | `libs/memory/`                       | Integrated as a library module named **Memory**. Provides multi-level AI memory capabilities. Minor refactoring to align with monorepo (e.g., package imports use TheCollective namespace). The Apache 2.0 license from mem0 is retained for this sub-folder.                                                                                                      |
| *PoseidonScientistV2* (AI Scientist system) | `libs/scientist/`                    | Adopted as **Scientist** module. Contains the AI research automation system (based on “The AI Scientist” project). Kept largely intact under `libs/scientist/ai_scientist/…`. Integrated with TheCollective’s memory and LLM backends (if applicable). Bazel rules added for Python scripts and any submodules.                                                    |
| *PoseidonScientist* (original v1)           | `archive/PoseidonScientist_v1/`      | **Archived** (legacy version). A README in this archive folder explains that the AI Scientist code was upgraded to V2 and directs to `libs/scientist/`. This archived code is removed from build graph.                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Additional Poseidon-related data* (if any) | `apps/poseidon/` or `libs/poseidon/` | Any other components from Poseidon’s repo (config files, scripts) are placed appropriately (e.g., config under `apps/poseidon/`, shared util code under `libs/poseidon/` if needed). Outdated or unused parts are moved to `archive/poseidon_misc/`.                                                                                                               |

*(PoseidonDashboard’s UI now lives alongside Poseidon logic, making Poseidon a multi-platform app. The PoseidonMemory (mem0) and Scientist modules become shared resources available to Poseidon and other parts of TheCollective. All identifiers changed to TheCollective branding. Swift code is freshly written with proper structure and documentation, adhering to Sam’s style guidelines.)*

### Storm (Voice Conversion & Music Generation)

This domain covers the Storm voice conversion toolkit and the integrated ACE-Step music generation model (originally combined in the Storm repo), plus any research offshoot.

| *Storm* (voice conversion + music) | `apps/storm/`                    | The Storm toolkit and ACE-Step scripts are placed in `apps/storm/core/` and `apps/storm/musicgen/` respectively. We maintain the combined functionality as a single service. ComfyUI node code is included under `apps/storm/comfyui_nodes/` for completeness, but marked optional – not built by default (it can be moved to archive if not needed in production). Bazel `BUILD` files define a Python binary or library for Storm and include necessary data file targets. External model files required by Storm (voice models, indexes) remain outside the repo (to be provided by user at runtime). |
| *StormResearch* (experimental)     | `archive/StormResearch/`         | Contains research experiments, e.g. alternative training routines or model experiments for Storm. Archived since core features were merged into Storm. A README here describes any notable differences and indicates that the active code is in `apps/storm/`. Where possible, any useful enhancements from StormResearch have been merged into `apps/storm/core/` (with appropriate credits in commit history).                                                                                                                                                                                         |

*(Storm’s Bazel setup leverages Python rules and possibly C/C++ rules if Storm includes native components. The integration ensures that one can build the Storm voice conversion system as part of TheCollective and even run its features in conjunction with other components. The combined Storm+ACE functionality remains accessible – e.g., enabling an AI assistant to use voice conversion and music generation in one workflow. Storm’s README is updated under TheCollective docs to reflect the new usage.)*

### Swarm Systems (Multi-Agent Orchestration)

This domain refers to the multi-agent orchestration frameworks: the OpenAI **Swarm** example, the user’s extended **Swarms** implementation, and the advanced **Swarmz** system design. We unify these into a single “Swarm” platform within TheCollective.

| **Source Repository**            | **Destination in TheCollective** | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *swarm* (OpenAI sample)          | `libs/swarm/openai_sample/`      | OpenAI’s **Swarm** (educational multi-agent orchestration framework) is included for reference. It’s not part of the active build (marked as excluded in Bazel), but having it in `libs/swarm/openai_sample/` with its original README helps developers understand the foundation of the pattern. Its presence is purely educational; no code directly depends on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Swarms* (user’s implementation) | `libs/swarm/extended/`           | The user-developed multi-agent system (as seen in Swarms repo, e.g., AgentManager, etc.) forms the basis of the new **Swarm** library. This code is placed in `libs/swarm/extended/` and refactored as needed to integrate with Swarmz’s design. For example, the `AgentManager` and related classes from here are merged into the unified agent system module. This becomes part of the build (Bazel package for multi-agent orchestration).                                                                                                                                     |
| *Swarmz* (next-gen system)       | `apps/swarmz/` (under agenetic/) | The ambitious multi-agent automation pipeline described in Swarmz is implemented as the **Swarmz** application under `apps/swarmz/agenetic/`. The design outlined (with agents pool, job queue, AI manager, etc.) is realized in code structure. Some code from *Swarms* is integrated here to accelerate development, but aligned to the Swarmz architecture (e.g., using `AgentManager` improvements). We treat Swarmz as the actively developed system for autonomous multi-agent workflows, and it’s fully integrated into Bazel (so it can be tested and run as part of CI). |
| *Swarmz* design docs             | `apps/swarmz/README.md`          | The detailed design from the Swarmz README (system design, requirements, etc.) is preserved in a README under `apps/swarmz/`. This ensures that the vision (autonomous operation, multi-AI agents, internet access, troubleshooting, research pipeline, multimodal capabilities, scalability, etc.) guides the implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| *Any redundant parts*            | `archive/Swarm_*/`               | If any components from *swarm*, *Swarms*, or older iterations are not used in the final integrated system (for example, scripts or duplicate logic), they are moved to `archive/` with appropriate notes. For instance, if *Swarms* had a separate entry script that is replaced by Swarmz’s controller, the old script goes to `archive/Swarms/old_scripts/`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

*(The unified Swarm system in TheCollective capitalizes on the robust design of Swarmz. We effectively promote Swarmz to the main implementation, while keeping earlier work (Swarm and Swarms) for reference and education. The multi-agent platform can now interact with TheCollective’s other parts – e.g., agents can use the memory layer or call the LLM runtime – forming a backbone for complex autonomous workflows. We ensure only one set of agent orchestration code is active to avoid confusion. All code is under TheCollective branding, and any configuration (like agent counts, model paths) is centralized for maintainability.)*

### LLM Runtime Integration (Llama.cpp and Recipes)

This domain is about local Large Language Model support. We integrate the C/C++ implementation of LLaMA and any related scripts or recipes for using models.

| **Source Repository**              | **Destination in TheCollective**              | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *llama.cpp* (C++ LLM backend)      | `libs/llm/llama_cpp/`                         | Brought in as **llama\_cpp** module. The entire code (C/C++ source for the LLaMA model inference) is placed here. Bazel builds it as a `cc_library` and a possible `cc_binary` for CLI usage. We preserve history for this fork where possible. Minor refactor: the library is wrapped with a Bazel-friendly BUILD and any platform-specific tweaks needed for Mac/Linux. No renaming of internal symbols (to ease upstream syncing), but namespacing in Bazel targets uses TheCollective (e.g., `//libs/llm/llama_cpp:libllama`). |
| *llama-recipes* (scripts, prompts) | `libs/llm/scripts/` or `tools/llama_recipes/` | The content from llama-recipes (e.g., example prompts, conversion scripts, Dockerfiles for LLMs) is included as supplementary material. If primarily documentation or utilities, it goes under `tools/llama_recipes/` with a README. If some parts are code used by TheCollective runtime, they could reside in `libs/llm/` (for instance, Python scripts for model quantization or prompt orchestration). We maintain the distinction that this is not core library code but supporting resources.                                |
| *(No conflict)*                    | *(n/a)*                                       | There were no overlapping files between llama.cpp and other repos. We ensure the license from llama.cpp (MIT) is included in its sub-directory, and note any modification in our global LICENSE file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

*(This integration allows TheCollective to run LLM inference on-device via llama.cpp. For example, the Poseidon assistant can use llama\_cpp as a backend if needed. The Bazel rules fetch any third-party dependencies (like `fp16` or `ggml` library code) as part of building llama.cpp. We keep the llama.cpp code separate enough to pull in future updates from upstream easily. The “recipes” are mainly archived in tools unless needed in code – ensuring they don’t bloat the build but remain accessible. Developers can refer to them to run fine-tuning or model conversion outside the main app.)*

### Whisper Speech Recognition Integration

This covers OpenAI’s Whisper model implementation in C++ (whisper.cpp) for local speech-to-text.

| **Source Repository** | **Destination in TheCollective** | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *whisper.cpp*         | `libs/llm/whisper_cpp/`          | Integrated as **whisper\_cpp** module, alongside llama\_cpp. Provides on-device speech recognition. Imported similarly as a C/C++ library with Bazel rules. No major refactoring of code; just build configuration. Ensured to include its original license (MIT) in the subfolder.                                                      |
| *(Whisper models)*    | **(not in repo)**                | *Note:* Whisper’s model weights (large binary `.bin` files) are not stored in the repo. Users must supply or download them separately (ensuring we avoid huge files in git). The usage is documented in TheCollective’s README (e.g., where to place whisper model files at runtime).                                                    |
| *Integration*         | `apps/poseidon/` (or services)   | We confirm that Poseidon or other apps can invoke Whisper via this library. For example, if PoseidonSwift (iOS) needs speech input, it can call into a wrapper around this whisper\_cpp library. We added Bazel build steps to compile whisper.cpp for relevant platforms (e.g., as a static lib for iOS and a binary for server/Linux). |

*(With whisper.cpp in the monorepo, TheCollective platform gains offline speech transcription capabilities. This ties in with LocalAI Speech-to-Speech as well – Whisper could be the speech-to-text part of that pipeline. All whisper-related source files use TheCollective branding where appropriate, though the core code remains largely as-is. Bazel’s cross-compilation capacities via rules\_cc are leveraged to build for multiple targets. We maintain compatibility with upstream whisper.cpp for easy updates.)*

### OpenHands Module Integration

The **OpenHands** repository is incorporated next. This likely contains either a computer-vision or hardware control library (for hand gesture recognition or robotic hand control).

| **Source Repository** | **Destination in TheCollective**  | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *OpenHands*           | `libs/vision/openhands/`          | The OpenHands project is placed under a new `vision` or `hardware` library section. We assume it’s a library (possibly C++ and/or Python) for hand tracking or gesture recognition. The code is built with Bazel (e.g., if C++ -> `cc_library` with OpenCV or other deps; if Python -> as a py\_library). Any heavy data or model files used by OpenHands are handled similar to other large assets (not checked in, or moved to a data depot). |
| *Integration*         | `apps/poseidon/` (potentially)    | If OpenHands was used in any app (perhaps for an AR interface or sign language input to the assistant), we integrate calls to it accordingly. Otherwise, it remains as a standalone library that TheCollective could utilize in the future (e.g., for vision-based agent input). We update any documentation to reflect that OpenHands is now part of TheCollective.                                                                            |
| *Documentation*       | `libs/vision/openhands/README.md` | Added/updated a README describing OpenHands usage within TheCollective. All references to original project naming are adjusted to TheCollective context, while preserving attributions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

*(Without specific code from OpenHands here, integration is done in principle. This library is ready for use by any Collective component. For instance, an agent in Swarmz could use OpenHands to interpret visual signals if that was a goal. The Bazel build might incorporate rules\_opencv or other dependencies if OpenHands relies on them. Ensuring those work on both Mac and Linux is part of the integration. As with others, license compliance for OpenHands is checked and the license file included in its folder.)*

### LocalAI and Speech-to-Speech Integration

This domain handles the **LocalAI** project (which provides a local OpenAI-compatible API for LLMs) and its **Speech-to-Speech** extension. By merging them, TheCollective gains a self-hosted AI service for both text and voice.

| **Source Repository**       | **Destination in TheCollective**        | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| *LocalAI* (API server)      | `apps/localai/`                         | The LocalAI server (likely a Go project) is brought in under `apps/localai/`. Its Go modules are converted to Bazel `go_repository` rules in WORKSPACE for dependencies, and the main is built via `go_binary`. This yields a self-contained binary for local LLM serving. We preserve its CLI and API interface (so it remains a drop-in OpenAI API replacement). Configuration files or model folders are adjusted to reside in TheCollective’s structure (e.g., default model directory in `apps/localai/models/`).                                                                                       |
| *Local-AI-Speech-to-Speech* | `apps/localai/s2s/`                     | Integrated as a sub-component of LocalAI if appropriate, or as a closely related service. For example, if Speech-to-Speech is a separate server or script (perhaps combining Whisper ASR and a TTS engine for responses), we include it in a subfolder. Bazel can build it (if in Go, another `go_binary`; if Python, a `py_binary`). The integration ensures that it can leverage the whisper\_cpp (for speech-to-text) and some TTS (maybe via other libraries) internally. We unify configuration so that one could run a single service for speech-to-speech or have it as a mode of the LocalAI server. |
| *Integration with Poseidon* | `apps/poseidon/` (client usage)         | The Poseidon app and others are configured to use LocalAI for local inference if desired. For instance, the Poseidon iOS app might have a mode to call the LocalAI server on-device (or on a local network) instead of an external API. We add notes in Poseidon’s README about how to start the LocalAI service (perhaps via a Bazel-built binary) and connect the app to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| *Model files*               | **(external)**                          | Like other model-heavy components, we **do not** include actual model weights for LocalAI’s models in the repo. Users will place ggml model files in a designated folder (documented). The monorepo might include example small models or none at all, to avoid repository bloat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Documentation & Config*    | `apps/localai/README.md` & config files | We update configuration (e.g., YAML or JSON that LocalAI might use for model registry) to fit the monorepo paths. Documentation for LocalAI is merged into TheCollective docs (how to add models, how to enable speech-to-speech). All references to original authors or repo are kept in attributions, but the service is now branded as part of TheCollective platform (perhaps “TheCollective Local AI Service”).                                                                                                                                                                                         |

*(By integrating LocalAI, TheCollective can operate fully offline AI services. This is particularly useful for the Poseidon assistant: it could use the local API for generating responses (text or even voice). The Speech-to-Speech component implies the assistant can listen via Whisper and speak via a TTS engine – presumably included or referenced by the LocalAI S2S project. We ensure the Bazel build can produce the necessary binaries on both macOS and Linux (using rules\_go for cross-OS builds). As with other parts, we maintain license notes: e.g., LocalAI’s Apache/MIT license is included. The `Info@The-Collective-I.co.uk` contact is added to any user-facing documentation of these services.)*

### Utility Tools (SOS, WTF, Stats, Model Baseline)

This domain collects the smaller repositories that appear to be utilities or experimental tools.

| **Source Repository** | **Destination in TheCollective** | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *SOS*                 | `libs/utils/` (or `archive/`)    | The purpose of “SOS” is unclear from name alone (“Save Our Ship” or an emergency tool?). We locate any source code and evaluate usage. If it’s a generally useful utility (e.g., debugging tool or system monitor), we merge it into `libs/utils/` as part of a combined utility library. If it’s very niche or deprecated, we archive it. A README or comments indicate how to use the SOS functionality if retained.                                                                                                                 |
| *WTF*                 | `libs/utils/` (or `archive/`)    | Similar handling to SOS. Possibly a tool for troubleshooting (“WTF” often signifies a diagnostic command, as in some Linux tools). If it can be integrated (for example, as a CLI tool under TheCollective tools), we do so under `tools/` or as part of a utils library. Otherwise archived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| *stats*               | `libs/utils/stats/`              | If “stats” is a library or script for gathering statistics (maybe app usage or performance stats), we integrate it as a utility library (`libs/utils/stats/`). For example, Poseidon might use it to log user interaction counts, etc. The code is refactored minimally to fit (e.g., adjusting any hard-coded paths or config). If it was a standalone app producing reports, we could keep it as a small tool in `tools/stats/`.                                                                                                     |
| *model\_baseline*     | `archive/model_baseline/`        | This sounds like an experimental ML baseline (possibly training code or evaluation for a model). It likely isn’t needed for production. We archive this entire repo in `archive/model_baseline/`, preserving all files and adding a README that explains its original intent and that it’s not part of the active build. If any of its insights are valuable to current models, those might be documented and integrated elsewhere (e.g., if it included a pre-trained baseline model for comparison, we might note that in our docs). |

*(Overall, these four small repos are handled to avoid cluttering the core system. SOS/WTF might be combined into a single “DevUtils” library if they are indeed developer-focused commands or debugging tools. By merging them, we reduce duplication and make them easy to maintain. If their function is not currently required, archiving is the safer route – they remain available for future revival. All archived ones include notes pointing to any replacement or stating they’re deprecated. We also verify licensing of these (likely MIT) and include attribution where needed.)*

### Obsidian Plugins (Knowledge Management Tools)

This domain includes the Obsidian plugin forks: for Pandoc export, Spaced Repetition, Translations, and Text Generator. These are plugins for Obsidian (a knowledge base app) that the user had likely customized or simply forked.

| **Source Repository**                             | **Destination in TheCollective**                        | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *obsidian-pandoc* (export to PDF/Word via Pandoc) | `tools/obsidian-plugins/obsidian-pandoc/`               | The source code for this Obsidian plugin is placed under a collective plugins directory. Since Obsidian plugins are typically JavaScript/TypeScript, we can keep their original structure. They are not part of TheCollective’s build, so they could also live in `archive/obsidian-plugins/`. However, to maintain them in one place, we include them in `tools/obsidian-plugins/` and exclude from Bazel. A README is added to explain their usage (they’re for Obsidian, not TheCollective product itself). |
| *obsidian-spaced-repetition*                      | `tools/obsidian-plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition/`    | Same approach as above. The plugin code remains intact. If the user had made modifications in their fork, those are preserved. We keep plugin manifests etc. This code won’t be built or tested by CI (since it’s unrelated to our Bazel targets), but having it in the monorepo eases centralized version control.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *obsidian-translations*                           | `tools/obsidian-plugins/obsidian-translations/`         | Integrated similarly. Possibly just JSON files or scripts for translating the Obsidian UI or notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *obsidian-textgenerator-plugin*                   | `tools/obsidian-plugins/obsidian-textgenerator-plugin/` | Integrated similarly. This plugin likely provides AI text generation inside Obsidian using OpenAI or local models. Since TheCollective itself deals with LLMs, there may be cross-interest – for instance, this plugin could be repurposed to use TheCollective’s LocalAI as a backend. We note that in documentation as a future enhancement.                                                                                                                                                                 |

*(These plugins are essentially archived within the monorepo. They won’t interfere with TheCollective’s build since we won’t include them in Bazel targets. We decided to include them in the repository (rather than leaving them separate) because the user specifically listed them, indicating a desire to track them in the unified VCS. Each plugin directory has a README pointing to the original plugin repo and stating the fork’s purpose if applicable. If the user intends to maintain their custom changes, they can do so here. Otherwise, the READMEs can suggest using the official versions. Including them poses minimal risk, aside from bloat, which we mitigate by excluding any `node_modules` or build artifacts before merging and adding .gitignore rules as needed.)*

### Miscellaneous Tools (Memos, Integuru, Mac Usage, Pake)

This domain covers a handful of varied projects that don’t squarely fit into the above domains: a note-taking application, a personal integration tool, a Mac usage tracker, and a web-to-desktop wrapper. We handle each appropriately:

| **Source Repository**          | **Destination in TheCollective** | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *memos* (open source note app) | `archive/memos/`                 | The `memos` project (a self-hosted memo/note application) is quite large and independent. We archive this fork rather than fully integrate it. A README explains that this project is maintained separately and provides a link to the upstream (usememos/memos) and any reason it was forked. If TheCollective needs note-taking functionality, we consider interfacing with memos via API rather than merging its code into our build. Hence, it’s kept for reference in archive.                                                                                         |
| *Integuru*                     | `tools/integuru/` or `archive/`  | Depending on what Integuru does (name suggests an “integration guru” – possibly a CI tool or data integrator), we decide integration. If it’s a small script or tool that could be useful to run as part of TheCollective’s system (for example, helping integrate with third-party services), we place it under `tools/integuru/` and perhaps include a Bazel rule if it’s runnable. If it’s not currently used, we archive it. Documentation for Integuru is scant; we include any we have to clarify its function.                                                       |
| *mac\_computer\_use*           | `tools/mac_usage/`               | This presumably tracks Mac usage (perhaps via logging screen time or active app?). We integrate it as a tool script in `tools/mac_usage/`. Possibly it’s an AppleScript or a small Swift command-line. We add a Bazel rule if needed (e.g., using `apple_binary` for an AppleScript or Swift CLI). If it’s just a script, we simply keep it for reference. This could be handy internally but not broadly applicable, so it’s not part of core build.                                                                                                                       |
| *Pake*                         | `tools/pake/`                    | The Pake repository (likely a tool to wrap web apps as desktop apps) is included in `tools/pake/`. We treat it as a third-party tool – e.g., if we have the source, we keep it but don’t integrate into Bazel except maybe to build a binary for personal use. Since Pake is well-known, the fork might have minor customizations (like adding specific website wrappers). We preserve those. If Pake requires Node/electron to build, we might just leave instructions to build it outside Bazel (unless we add rules\_nodejs for it, which is probably overkill for now). |

*(These miscellaneous projects are mostly archived or kept as isolated tools. None of them is critical to TheCollective’s primary mission of an AI platform, but they are part of the user’s codebase so we include them for completeness. By centralizing them, the user can retire separate repos. We ensure each is documented and clearly separated from core modules. TheCollective’s main CI will likely ignore these to avoid unnecessary complexity (e.g., we won’t run memos’ web app tests in our CI). If any of these become relevant (for instance, if TheCollective wants to incorporate memos as a knowledge source for the assistant), we can later write integration code in the monorepo to interface with them.)*

### Legacy Module (Superpower-ChatGPT Extension)

The **superpower-chatgpt** repository is treated as a legacy codebase. It was an extension providing additional UI features for ChatGPT’s web interface. We include it in the monorepo in an archived state.

| **Source Repository**                           | **Destination in TheCollective** | **Notes / Changes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *superpower-chatgpt* (legacy browser extension) | `archive/superpower-chatgpt/`    | Archived in entirety. This codebase (which likely includes a Chrome extension manifest, JS/TS files, etc.) is not integrated into any application but saved for reference. A README in this folder explains its original purpose (enhancing ChatGPT web UI) and notes that it’s deprecated. It also references where new development might occur (if any) or directs users to the original extension if they need that functionality. We do **not** include this in any Bazel build or CI checks. All branding remains as legacy (we keep the original name in code to avoid breaking it), but we prepend an archival notice in the README. |

*(Archiving Superpower-ChatGPT ensures we don’t lose its history, but it keeps the monorepo focused. If, in the future, TheCollective wanted to offer a similar extension or incorporate some features into Poseidon’s UI, developers can look at this code for guidance. For now, it’s a read-only part of the repo. We maintain license terms of the extension code within that folder and attribute the original author appropriately in the README. The presence of this code has no effect on our build/test processes.)*

## **Bazel Build Configuration and CI Setup**

With all code unified, we set up Bazel from scratch to handle building across languages (Swift, Kotlin/Java, Python, Go, C/C++). Below are specifications for key Bazel files and the CI workflow.

### Bazel WORKSPACE and BUILD Files

In the root `WORKSPACE`, we declare all necessary Bazel rules and external dependencies. For example:

```python
# WORKSPACE (excerpt)
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

# Bazel rule for Apple (iOS/Mac) builds
http_archive(
    name = "rules_apple",
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/releases/download/1.0.0/rules_apple-1.0.0.tar.gz",
    sha256 = "<SHA256HASH>",
)
load("@rules_apple//apple:repositories.bzl", "apple_rules_dependencies", "apple_rules_ios_dependencies")
apple_rules_dependencies()
apple_rules_ios_dependencies()

# Bazel rule for Swift Package Manager integration
http_archive(
    name = "rules_swift_package_manager",
    url = "https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_swift_package_manager/releases/download/v0.6.1/rules_swift_package_manager-v0.6.1.tar.gz",
    sha256 = "<SHA256HASH>",
)
load("@rules_swift_package_manager//:repositories.bzl", "swift_package_manager_dependencies")
swift_package_manager_dependencies()

# Bazel rule for Go (to build LocalAI)
http_archive(
    name = "io_bazel_rules_go",
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.39.0/rules_go-v0.39.0.tar.gz",
    sha256 = "<SHA256HASH>",
)
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:deps.bzl", "go_rules_dependencies", "go_register_toolchains")
go_rules_dependencies()
go_register_toolchains()

# ... (similar for rules_cc, rules_python, etc., as needed) ...

# External Swift Packages (if Poseidon iOS or others use SPM packages)
load("@rules_swift_package_manager//:workspace.bzl", "swift_package")
swift_package(
    name = "Alamofire",  # example Swift package
    repository_url = "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git",
    revision = "5.7.1",
)
```

This defines the required rules: `rules_apple` to build iOS/macOS apps, `rules_swift_package_manager` to pull Swift PM dependencies (so we can manage any Swift libraries via SPM), and rules for Go (for LocalAI), C++ and Python. We then use these in BUILD files throughout the repo.

Each directory (app or lib) has a `BUILD.bazel`. For instance, the Poseidon iOS app and library:

```python
# apps/poseidon/ios/BUILD.bazel
load("@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple:ios.bzl", "ios_application")
load("//apps/poseidon/ios:swift_pkg_deps.bzl", "SWIFT_DEPS")  # hypothetical file listing SPM deps

swift_library(
    name = "PoseidonIOSLib",
    srcs = glob(["Sources/**/*.swift"]),
    deps = SWIFT_DEPS + [
        "//libs/memory:memory_lib",        # PoseidonMemory integrated library
        "//libs/scientist:scientist_lib",  # PoseidonScientist integrated library
        "//libs/llm/llama_cpp:llama_lib",  # LLaMA runtime (if used on-device)
        "//libs/llm/whisper_cpp:whisper_lib",  # Whisper (if speech input on device)
    ],
)

ios_application(
    name = "PoseidonIOS",
    bundle_id = "uk.co.thecollective.poseidon",  # updated bundle identifier
    families = ["iphone", "ipad"],
    infoplist = "Info.plist",
    provisioning_profile = "//:PoseidonMobileProvision",  # reference to provisioning profile if needed
    deps = [":PoseidonIOSLib"],
)
```

Likewise, for Android (using Bazel’s Android rules):

```python
# apps/poseidon/android/BUILD.bazel
android_library(
    name = "PoseidonAndroidLib",
    srcs = glob(["app/src/main/java/**/*.java", "app/src/main/kotlin/**/*.kt"]),
    manifest = "app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml",
    resource_files = glob(["app/src/main/res/**"]),
    deps = [
        "//libs/memory:memory_lib",
        # (Include any external Android AARs or libraries via mavens in WORKSPACE if needed)
    ],
)

android_binary(
    name = "PoseidonAndroid",
    manifest = "app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml",
    deps = [":PoseidonAndroidLib"],
    custom_package = "uk.co.thecollective.poseidon",  # new package name
)
```

For libraries like Storm (if mostly Python/C++), we could have:

```python
# apps/storm/BUILD.bazel (simplified)
py_binary(
    name = "storm_tool",
    srcs = glob(["core/**/*.py", "musicgen/**/*.py"]),
    deps = [
        "//libs/utils:stats_lib",  # example of using a util lib
        "//libs/llm/whisper_cpp:whisper_lib",  # maybe Storm could use Whisper for audio processing
    ],
    main = "core/storm_main.py",  # hypothetical entry point
)
```

For C++ libs (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp):

```python
# libs/llm/llama_cpp/BUILD.bazel
cc_library(
    name = "llama_lib",
    srcs = glob(["*.c", "*.cc", "*.cpp", "*.h"]),  # all source files from llama.cpp
    hdrs = glob(["*.h"]),
    defines = ["GGML_USE_ACCELERATE"],  # example define for Apple Accelerate on macOS
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

We also use `select()` in Bazel if needed to toggle platform-specific flags (e.g., use Accelerate framework on macOS for llama.cpp). The Swift Package Manager rule usage is encapsulated in a `swift_pkg_deps.bzl` (referenced above) for clarity; it would translate Swift package manifests into Bazel targets.

All Swift code follows a consistent style: at the top of each Swift file we might have a comment like:

```swift
// TheCollective – Poseidon iOS – Created by T.Rex-Baby on 2025-06-01
```

to satisfy the branding guidelines. Similarly, for other languages we include such header comments where appropriate.

### Continuous Integration Workflow (GitHub Actions)

We set up GitHub Actions to build and test TheCollective on both macOS and Ubuntu Linux. An example CI workflow file is as follows:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Build and Test TheCollective

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        bazel_version: [6.3.2]  # example Bazel version
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Bazel
        uses: philwo/actions-setup-bazel@v1
        with:
          version: ${{ matrix.bazel_version }}

      - name: Install Apple Toolchain (MacOS)
        if: runner.os == 'macOS'
        run: sudo xcode-select -s "/Applications/Xcode_14.3.app/Contents/Developer"  # ensure a specific Xcode if needed

      - name: Build All Targets
        run: bazel build //... --verbose_failures

      - name: Run Tests
        run: bazel test //... --test_output=errors
```

This workflow uses a matrix to run on both Linux and macOS. On Mac, it will be able to build iOS targets (thanks to Xcode and rules\_apple) – for instance, it can compile the iOS app and run any unit tests for it (though it cannot run iOS simulators on a GitHub-hosted mac runner for UI tests, we would rely on unit tests or simply build success for iOS). On Linux, it builds everything except obviously it will skip iOS-specific targets (Bazel will know not to attempt iOS build on Linux, due to rules\_apple configuration). Both platforms will build C++ libraries (llama.cpp etc.), Python, Go, etc.

We’ve configured caching implicitly via GitHub Actions default caching for Bazel (the `actions-setup-bazel` action enables caching of Bazel outputs between runs to speed up CI). The CI is prepared to scale to other platforms: for example, we could add `windows-latest` to the matrix in the future once the code (and Bazel rules) support Windows builds for relevant parts. At the moment, Windows might not be priority (since iOS and some ML libs might not build on Windows), but the CI definition is easily extendable.

Additionally, we plan separate jobs or workflows for specialized checks if needed, e.g., a linter/formatting job to ensure all code (Swift, Python, etc.) follows style guidelines, and perhaps a job that publishes artifacts (like compiled binaries or an iOS .ipa) when a release is tagged. The CI is set up with TheCollective’s future growth in mind.

## **Integration Timeline**

Below is a Gantt-style timeline estimating the phases of this consolidation project. Each phase represents a set of tasks from planning through to full integration, testing, and deprecation of old repositories. (Dates are illustrative starting points.)

```

*(In this timeline, Phase 1 involves all preparatory work (already largely completed in planning this document). Phase 2 (early June 2025) focuses on moving code into the monorepo and sorting it. Phase 3 spans mid-June to early July for implementing Bazel builds and performing necessary refactoring (especially rewriting the iOS app in SwiftUI and folding in platform-specific code). Phase 4 covers thorough testing by July. Phase 5 in late July finalizes documentation, CI, and formal deprecation of the old repositories. This suggests roughly a 6-8 week project timeline. We buffer time for unforeseen issues (e.g. build tool adjustments or dependency fixes).)*

## **Risk Register and Mitigations**

The integration comes with several risks. We identify key risks – including those mentioned (licensing, large files, fragile dependencies) – and others encountered, and outline mitigation strategies for each:

| **Risk**                                                                                                                                    | **Impact**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Mitigation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **License Conflicts** <br>(Different open-source licenses across components)                                                                | High legal risk if licenses are incompatible (e.g., mixing GPL code could impose unwanted obligations on the whole repo). The repos have Apache 2.0 (Mem0), MIT (likely OpenAI components), etc. If not handled, TheCollective might inadvertently violate a license or need to open source proprietary code.                                                                                                                                                                               | Audit each repository’s license. Keep each component’s license file in its folder and include a section in TheCollective’s top-level LICENSE noting multiple licenses. Avoid combining code in a way that triggers incompatibilities. For instance, do not include any GPL-licensed code in binaries that we don’t intend to GPL. If any component is GPL (none observed so far), isolate it (perhaps keep it in archive or as an optional plugin). Use Apache/MIT for our own new code. When in doubt, consult legal advice and possibly seek re-licensing permissions for critical components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Large Files (Model Weights & Data)** <br>(Potential repository bloat and Git performance issues)                                          | Very high if huge model files are committed – Git history would balloon, making the repo hard to clone and slowing down CI. For example, Storm expects model files for voices which are not provided in code; likewise llama.cpp and whisper.cpp require multi-GB model files externally.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Do not commit large binaries.** Instead, use pointers: e.g., provide scripts to download models or instruct users where to place them. Leverage Git LFS for any moderately large but necessary files (if needed, e.g., a 100 MB test data file). The CI will be configured with caching but will not attempt to download full models (we can use smaller stub files for tests). We have clearly documented for each relevant module how to obtain required data (e.g., “Place Whisper model `.bin` in `libs/llm/whisper_cpp/models/` before running”). By keeping the repo lean, we maintain fast clone and build times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Fragile or Conflicting Dependencies** <br>(Multiple projects with different or conflicting dependency versions, environment requirements) | High risk of build or runtime failures. For example, PoseidonScientist (AI Scientist) might require specific Python packages and even executes untrusted code, while PoseidonMemory uses others. Dependencies may clash (one needs a newer numpy, another an older). Also environment fragility: AI Scientist expects certain environment (GPU, internet) which in integrated form might break or need isolation. If not managed, builds could fail or software could behave unpredictably. | Use Bazel’s hermetic build approach: isolate each package’s dependencies. For Python, use `pip_install` or similar to declare requirements per module, avoiding system-wide installs. Where possible, align versions (upgrade one component’s dependency to match another’s if feasible). If two components truly conflict, containerize one of them (e.g., run the AI Scientist in a Docker sandbox separate from the main process). The AI Scientist’s caution about executing code is addressed by *disabling any unsafe operations by default* in integrated mode and requiring an explicit flag to enable full autonomy. This prevents accidental harm. We also add comprehensive tests to catch dependency issues early – e.g., ensuring that importing PoseidonMemory and Scientist in the same Python process doesn’t raise version errors. Continuous integration will run on clean VMs, exposing any missing dependency declaration.                                                                 |
| **Integration Bugs & Regressions** <br>(Behavior changes when everything unified)                                                           | Medium risk that something that worked in isolation breaks in the monorepo. Possibilities: Path assumptions might be wrong now (file paths changed), or combined usage reveals bugs (e.g., memory not updating between modules, or Storm’s audio pipeline not connecting to Poseidon as expected). There’s also a risk that rewriting the iOS app could introduce new bugs not in the original (since that part is essentially a fresh code).                                               | Thorough testing phase (as indicated in timeline). We will run each major component as a standalone as well as in integrated scenarios: e.g., ensure Poseidon’s unit tests pass, run Storm’s voice conversion on sample input and verify output matches the pre-merge behavior, run Swarmz scenarios that were documented, etc. We bring over any tests from each repo into the monorepo. If some projects lacked automated tests, we perform manual testing, especially for UIs (Poseidon iOS/Android) and crucial logic. Using Bazel’s test targets helps systematically run everything. Additionally, we plan an internal beta: for instance, have team members use the unified Poseidon app and see if all expected features from old versions are present. For the iOS rewrite, we double-check all features against the legacy PoseidonSwift (using its code as a reference implementation). Incremental integration (don’t turn on all new features at once) will isolate issues.                       |
| **Performance & Resource Use** <br>(Monorepo build or runtime inefficiencies)                                                               | Low to medium risk. Bazel monorepo might lengthen build times if not tuned (building everything vs what’s needed). Also, running multiple heavy modules (LLM + memory + voice + agent system concurrently) could strain resources. For example, running an AI Scientist experiment alongside a voice conversion could max out RAM/CPU.                                                                                                                                                      | Optimize Bazel configs: use granular build targets so we can build/test specific parts without rebuilding the world. Leverage Bazel caching and remote cache in CI to speed up rebuilds. For runtime, since TheCollective is more a platform than a single app, it’s expected not all modules run at once unless a scenario calls for it. If we foresee combined use (like an agent that does *everything*), we ensure our infrastructure can handle it (maybe by not loading all models into memory simultaneously; e.g., load Whisper model on demand, then unload to free memory before loading a large LLaMA model). Document hardware requirements for heavy use cases (so users know if you want to run all subsystems, you need X RAM, etc.). Monitor performance during integration testing and profile as needed (we can use the `stats` module or similar for internal benchmarking).                                                                                                                |
| **Team Learning Curve** <br>(Bazel and monorepo practices are new to some developers)                                                       | Medium risk to productivity initially. Developers used to independent repos or different build tools might be confused or make mistakes (e.g., not understanding Bazel target patterns, or accidentally breaking dependencies). Without buy-in, some might try to circumvent the monorepo structure.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Provide training and documentation: we include in `docs/` a “Monorepo Guide” explaining how to add a new dependency, how to run a specific app, how to debug Bazel build issues, etc. We also set up pre-commit checks and CI feedback to catch common errors (for example, if someone modifies a BUILD file incorrectly, CI will flag it). Initial pair-programming or code reviews by Bazel-proficient team members will help others get up to speed. We can also leverage Bazel’s migration tools (like `bazel query` to understand dependencies) to help folks adapt. Over time, the benefits (one codebase, one build command) will outweigh the learning curve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Maintenance of Upstream Updates** <br>(Forked third-party projects needing updates)                                                       | Medium risk: Projects like llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, mem0 etc. will continue to evolve externally. By pulling them into a monorepo, we must manually track upstream changes. If we don’t, we may fall behind on critical fixes or improvements. On the flip side, updating might be non-trivial if we have local tweaks.                                                                                                                                                                      | Assign maintainers for each major third-party component in the monorepo. Their job is to watch upstream (subscribe to releases) and periodically vendor in updates. We can use a subtree or `git import` approach to bring changes while preserving our minor modifications. Bazel can help here by isolating these libs – e.g., one could even swap out the whole `libs/llm/llama_cpp` directory with an updated version and run tests to see if anything breaks. We document any local changes we made to upstream code to reapply or upstream them properly. In some cases, we might decide to use Bazel external repositories to track a project (for instance, treat llama.cpp as an external dependency at a known commit). But since commit history preservation was a goal, we chose vendoring in. So continuous vigilance is the mitigation. Also, if an upstream introduces a license or architectural change we can’t accept, we re-evaluate if we remain at an older version or find alternatives. |

*(Each risk above is actively managed to ensure the success of TheCollective integration. For example, to double-check license compliance, an internal review is done with each code merge. As another example, the containerization note for AI Scientist means we might incorporate a Docker-based test for that part, given its complexity – ensuring even if it’s fragile, it’s contained. By logging these risks and resolutions, the team remains aware throughout the project.)*

---

In conclusion, **TheCollective** monorepo will unify our diverse projects under one roof, with a clean modular structure and consistent branding. We have mapped every repository to its new home and taken care to preserve functionality while modernizing where needed (especially for Swift code and cross-platform builds). The deliverables include a functional Bazel build on Mac and Linux, a CI pipeline running tests on both, and comprehensive documentation for the new structure. By following this plan, we ensure a smooth transition from a scattered codebase to an integrated collective – setting the stage for more streamlined development and innovative cross-component features in the future.&#x20;

## 1 · Branding & coding-rules compliance

## 2 · Repository tree

### What’s perfect

* Top-level domains (`apps/`, `libs/`, `tools/`, `archive/`) match the seed tree.
* Legacy repos preserved in `archive/` and excluded from the Bazel graph with pointers — exactly what we asked.
* Large-weight policy (no models checked in) is explicit.

### Two structural nits

1. **Android under Poseidon**
   The earlier design kept *all* client targets inside one `poseidon/Targets/` folder.
   *Recommendation:* move `apps/poseidon/android/` → `apps/poseidon/Targets/android/` (mirrors `macOS`, `iOS`, `iPadOS`, `watchOS`). Keeps the repo flatter and matches Bazel target naming (`//apps/poseidon/Targets/android:PoseidonAndroid`).

2. **Duplicate Swarm namespace**
   You now have `apps/swarmz/…` *and* `libs/swarm/…`. That’s fine, but make sure the **library** is `libs/agents/` (or similar) so people don’t confuse the runtime with the reference sample.
   *Example:*

   ```
   libs/
     agents/        # formerly libs/swarm
       openai_sample/
       extended/
   apps/
     swarmz/        # production-grade orchestration service
   ```

## 3 · Bazel & CI details

| Topic                | Comment                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bazel WORKSPACE**  | Good selection of rules. Add `rules_detekt` (Kotlin linter) if Android stays.                                                                            |
| **Swift-PM interop** | You chose `rules_swift_package_manager` ✓. Add a note that the researcher must run `swift package resolve` *once* locally so Bazel hashes the lock-file. |
| **Android rules**    | The iOS/macCatalyst side is sorted; just confirm you’ll include `rules_android` (or `rules_kotlin`) in WORKSPACE if you keep the Android client.         |
| **CI**               | Matrix and caching look solid. Add a second macOS job that runs `bazel coverage //apps/poseidon/...` so code-coverage badges stay green.                 |

## 4 · Open questions for the researcher

Please ping them with these final clarifiers before they cut code:

1. **Separator snippet** – include one canonical block they can copy-paste.
2. **Android client** – confirm it really ships (or archive for v1). Choice changes the WORKSPACE footprint.
3. **Renaming `libs/swarm`** – agree on `libs/agents` or keep as-is?
4. **Detekt / Android lints** – add or defer?
5. **Docker images** – the plan skipped container build targets (LocalAI, AI-Scientist). Should we add Bazel `container_image` rules now or in a later sprint?

---

## 5 · Next deliverables I can generate on demand

* **WORKSPACE + empty BUILD skeletons** wired with `rules_apple`, `rules_swift_package_manager`, `rules_go`, `rules_python`, `rules_cc`.
* **Poseidon Swift-multiplatform package template** with Sam-style separators pre-populated.
* **GitHub Actions `ci.yml` including coverage job**.
* **Mermaid diagram** for the final repo tree (if you want a visual TOC).

Just tell me which artefact you’d like first (“Workspace please”, “Swift template”, etc.) or fire off any extra edits, and I’ll produce the full, paste-ready code or docs.
